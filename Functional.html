    <h4>Types of functional modifications:</h4>
    <p>There are variety of modifications in the functional modifications of cars that are given below:</p>
    
    <img class="image_right" src="Data/navigation.jpg" alt="sattelite navigation system" align="right">
    <h4>1.Satellite navigation system:</h4>
    <p>A satellite navigation system is a very useful upgrade if you do not already have it in your car.
         Most automobile manufacturers offer this feature in their cars these days. A navigation system 
         uses Global Positioning System (GPS) to chalk out the best route from point A to point B. It 
         provides information regarding the traffic conditions and thus saves time and makes the journey
          as hasslefree as possible. <br>

    <img class="image_left" src="Data/conditioner.jpg" alt="air conditioner system" align="left">
    <h4>2.Air conditioning:</h4>
    <p>
        Car air conditioning is a system within your car that allows you to cool the interior air of the 
        vehicle in hot weather, providing for a cooler environment for the occupants. Refrigerant changes
         from gas to liquid, and back to gas, and is a vital part of the air conditioning system and 
         process.<br>

    <img class="image_right" src="Data/phone.jpg" alt="car phone" align="right">
    <h4>3.Car Phone:</h4>
    <p>
        The car phone offers the driver, the liberty of using his/her phone while driving.
         The driver can make or receive phone calls without even touching the phone. It has
          become even easier to use a car phone these days as most of the modern infotainment
           systems in cars now offer bluetooth compatibility which helps them connect their phones
            to the car’s media system directly. <br>

    <img class="image_left" src="Data/parking.jpg" alt="parking sensors" align="left">
    <h4>4.Parking sensors:</h4>
    <P>
        Parking a car can be a tricky job, especially in tight corners. Parking sensors make the whole
        easier. Parking sensors can guide the driver while parking by providing information regarding
        obstacles that are in the way. Many cars offer parking sensors as a standard in-built feature
         these days. But, if your car doesn’t have one, it is definitely a good modification to be 
         considered.

    <img class="image_right" src="Data/rack.jpg" alt="oof racks" align="right">
    <h4>5.Roof racks:</h4>
    <p>
        A roof rack is a perfect carrier that enables you to load up your vehicle and carry bulky equipment
        from sporting goods to camping gear and a range of other items. It's also important to remember to
         always secure your load regardless of the type of roof rack or rail installed to your vehicle.

    <img class="image_left" src="Data/conditioner.jpg" alt="hand controls" align="left">
    <h4>6.Hand controls:</h4>
    <p>
        Hand controls allow people with physical disabilities the ability to drive accessible vehicles
         independentlyusing alternative methods. Hand controls allow the driver to operate both the 
         brake and gas pedal using levers that are typically mounted below the steering wheel and 
         attach to the pedals themselves. <br>

    <img class="image_right" src="Data/headlights.jpg" alt="additional headLights" align="right">
    <h4>7.Additional headLights:</h4>
    <p>
        Additional headlights provide significant additional safety when visibility is poor and
         in bad weather conditions. The additional light often gives drivers those vital seconds
          in critical hazardous situations. Upgrading standard vehicle lighting is always to be 
          recommended and can save lives. <br>

    <img class="image_left" src="Data/roof.jpg" alt="sunroofs" align="left">
    <h4>8.Installation of sunroofs:</h4>
    <p>
        Sunroof allows fresh air in the cabin when driving. It gives freedom and creates 
        sort of a romantic ambience. If you plan to keep the windows open, there is so much
         noise of the gushing wind which makes it too noisy even to converse with the fellow
          passengers. The sunroof is very good in such situations. <br>
